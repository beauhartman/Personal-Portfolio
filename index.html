		      <br>
		      <p>Way back in Septebmer 2014, I decided to test my hand at Web Design. In short, it's been a fruitful journey, except for the fact that I have absolutely nothing to show for it.</p>
		      <br>
		      <p>That's not entirely true, because I suppose I do have my ALL-BUT IMPRESSIVE portfolio of websites I've created in the past. A link to them is included above in the header, and some of their (after-acquired) titles are listed to the left. In addition to these below-average work products, I suppose I have the ever-so-important feedback from my clients.</p>
		      <br>
		      <p>Consistent feedback from my clients is a key to my lack of success. Time and again I hear the same thing from my clients. They tell me, "DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB!" It's these precise words that keep me motivated to work hard at my other job, and that also keep me from trying to improve my web design techniques. Thank God for client feedback.</p>
